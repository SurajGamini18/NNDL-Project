# Abstract
In today’s world, the ubiquity of mobile phones is undeniable, with nearly every individual possessing a device equipped with essential functions such as messaging and call- ing. Unfortunately, this widespread access has also led to an increase in spam communications. Traditionally, spam was mostly associated with incessant phone calls from telemarketers and fraudulent schemes. However, with the decreasing costs of bulk messaging services provided by network carriers, a significant shift has occurred from voice calls to text messages. Consequently, SMS (Short Message Service) has increasingly become inundated with unsolicited advertisements and fraudulent offers. This surge in spam messages not only disrupts daily communication but also poses significant challenges in differentiating legitimate messages from spam, commonly referred to as ’ham’. Addressing this issue is critical to ensure the integrity of communication via text messages. To combat this problem, our study employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques coupled with machine learning algorithms. By leveraging these advanced computational methods, we aim to accurately classify and separate spam mes- sages from legitimate ones. For our research, we utilized a dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository, applying four straightforward classification models. These models include decision trees, na ̈ıve Bayes, and Random Forest. Each model was rigorously tested for its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and ham messages. After evaluating the performance of these models, it became apparent that the Random Forest model was the most effective, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 99.4%. This high level of accuracy indicates that Random forest is particularly suited for this task, offering a reliable method for filtering spam from legitimate text messages. Our findings highlight the potential of machine learning in enhancing communication security and efficiency by minimizing the impact of unsolicited and potentially harmful content.
